             <p>My name is Kunal Rajput, basically I am a self-taught front-end developer. I started my front end development journey a year ago. Within a year, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and in frameworks, I learned Bootstrap and React.js. I am very passionate about coding. I have also learned to use the Figma tool. I have learned front-end development from the internet and have also built projects such as portfolio websites, tic-tac-toe game, and calculator. During this time, I have also learned AI tools like ChatGPT to help speed up and improve my work. I am currently working on backend as well so that I can become a full stack developer.</p>
